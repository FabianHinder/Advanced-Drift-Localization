## What this repo is about

Concept drift -- the change of the data-generating distribution over time -- is a central problem for monitoring systems and deployed machine-learning models.
Drift localization is the task of identifying which samples (or which regions of the input space) are affected by a drift. Localizing affected samples is an important precursor to meaningful explanations and downstream actions (retraining, alerting, root-cause analysis). This repository will gather code for (i) algorithms that localize drift, and (ii) benchmarking / evaluation tools used in the related papers.

## What Is Drift Localization?

**Drift localization:** given two (or more) phases of a data stream (e.g., before / after a suspected change), decide for each sample whether it belongs to a region of the data space that has undergone distributional change. In practice this means identifying the samples (or regions) that were generated by a different distribution after the drift event so that they can be further analyzed or explained. This formulation allows treating localization as a supervised / model-based learning problem (train a discriminative model that separates pre- and post-drift samples and use its outputs to mark and explain which samples/regions are drifting). [1,2]

Drift localization is particularly relevant for model-based drift explanation [3], which enable the useage of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand *how* the distribution changed.
